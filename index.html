          <p>This project features an autonomous drone designed to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time using ultrasonic sensors. By continuously scanning its environment, the drone intelligently adjusts its flight path to prevent collisions, enabling safe and efficient navigation even in complex or dynamic spaces.

            Key technologies include microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and autonomous control logic. This project demonstrates a practical application of robotics, sensor fusion, and embedded systems in aerial navigation.
